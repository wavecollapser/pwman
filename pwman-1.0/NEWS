    Made the progarm a GPLv3 program

    uses bash,gpg,vim for editing gpg encrypted password files


FUTURE TODO:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
    link with -lncurses , then we dont need dialog(1) frontend

    but dialog(1) frontend is more 'portable' to GNU
    GNU base install comes with dialog(1) usually.

    if we change to ncurses we have to add it as a dependency
    that has to be compiled first.
